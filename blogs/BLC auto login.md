And you're all set. From now on, whenever you visit the https://elearn.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/ page, if you're not already logged in, this extension will automatically input your username and password in the login section and attempt to log you in. If you're already logged in, the extension won't take any action.

## Action
Here's what you need to know about the toggle button: if the button is yellow, it means that your account credentials are blank and you won't be able to use the auto-login feature. On the other hand, if the button turns green, it indicates that everything is set up correctly and you can expect the auto-login to work. If you want to disable this feature, simply toggle the button to turn it off.
